A flutter project using clean architecture.

## This project is a personalized course project

This projects is from reso coder clean architecture with some modifications in approach and libraries.

A list of the changes made here:

* change of the naming convention for implementations classes. Using the name of the library instead of the code smell "Impl".
* a change in code organization to better comply with personal practices.
* use of the freezed package.
* use of json serializable.
* use of riverpod as state managment tool and state notifier.
* use of connectivity package.
* remove of get_it package.
* minor UI Changes
* added some more tests.
 

In this project i learn to:

* implement clean architecture practices to write organized, clean and testable code.
* refined my habilities of consuming API's by using cache techinques (simple ones).
* state reaction to connectivity chages.
* use of the retry package to retry connections.
* refined my knowledge of the repository pattern.
* refined my knowledge of the denpendency injection principle
* refined my knowledge of the dependency inversion principle.
* test my projects and mock classes.

All my thanks to reso coder and his guides for becoming a better flutter developer.

This is a project from a course but i can translate it to another projects and make use of it to build better, more complex apps.
